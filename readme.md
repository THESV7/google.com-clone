# 🌐 Google Clone – Auto Dark/Light Theme (Tailwind v4 CSS‑First)

A simple static clone of Google’s homepage using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS v4.1**, with **automatic dark/light mode** powered by OS/browser `prefers-color-scheme`, configured entirely in CSS so there’s **no `tailwind.config.js` or JavaScript**, and focused solely on theme practice—not mobile responsiveness.
